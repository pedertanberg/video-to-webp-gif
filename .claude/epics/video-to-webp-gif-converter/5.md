# Task: Video Player Implementation

## Description
Build a custom video player with timeline scrubbing capabilities, playback controls, and preview functionality. The player needs to support precise frame-level seeking for accurate start/end point selection and provide visual feedback during scrubbing operations. This forms the foundation for the range selection functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Custom video player with standard controls (play, pause, volume, fullscreen)
- [ ] Interactive timeline scrubber with precise seeking capabilities
- [ ] Frame-accurate time display and position feedback
- [ ] Keyboard controls for video navigation (spacebar, arrow keys)
- [ ] Visual preview thumbnails during timeline scrubbing
- [ ] Responsive player sizing that maintains aspect ratio
- [ ] Loading states and buffering indicators
- [ ] Error handling for corrupted or unsupported video files
- [ ] Accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: HTML5 video element with custom control overlay
- Key considerations:
  - Precise frame seeking for accurate range selection
  - Performance optimization for smooth scrubbing
  - Cross-browser video codec support validation
  - Memory management during video playback
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/js/modules/VideoPlayer.js` - Core video player logic
  - `/js/modules/TimelineControls.js` - Timeline scrubbing functionality
  - `/styles/player.css` - Custom player styling and controls
  - `/index.html` - Video player markup structure

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 (Setup & Foundation) - requires basic HTML/CSS structure
- [ ] HTML5 video element browser support
- [ ] RequestAnimationFrame API for smooth animations
- [ ] Canvas API for thumbnail generation during scrubbing

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with custom video player controls
- [ ] Timeline scrubbing provides frame-accurate seeking
- [ ] Player maintains aspect ratio across different screen sizes
- [ ] All keyboard controls work as expected
- [ ] Loading and error states provide clear user feedback
- [ ] Performance optimized for smooth playback and scrubbing
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified for HTML5 video features
