# Task: FFmpeg.wasm Integration

## Description
Integrate FFmpeg.wasm for client-side video processing and WebP conversion. Implement the complete video processing pipeline including WebAssembly module loading, video segment extraction, WebP encoding, and efficient memory management to handle large video files without browser crashes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] FFmpeg.wasm library successfully loaded and initialized
- [ ] Video segment extraction based on user-selected time range
- [ ] WebP conversion with optimized quality and compression settings
- [ ] Memory management to prevent browser crashes with large files
- [ ] Error handling for unsupported video formats and corrupted files
- [ ] Progress callbacks for real-time conversion status updates
- [ ] WebAssembly feature detection with graceful fallbacks
- [ ] Conversion settings optimization (frame rate, quality, size)
- [ ] File size validation and limits (max input/output sizes)

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: WebAssembly module with Web Worker for background processing
- Key considerations:
  - Load FFmpeg.wasm efficiently (~25MB download)
  - Implement proper memory cleanup after processing
  - Handle video codec compatibility (H.264, VP9, etc.)
  - Optimize WebP settings for file size vs quality balance
  - Provide cancellation mechanism for long-running conversions
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/js/modules/Converter.js` - Main conversion orchestrator
  - `/js/workers/ffmpeg-worker.js` - Web Worker for FFmpeg processing
  - `/js/modules/MemoryManager.js` - Memory cleanup utilities
  - `/js/modules/FormatValidator.js` - Video format validation
  - `/js/modules/ConversionSettings.js` - WebP encoding parameters

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 - Setup & Foundation (requires basic project structure)
- [ ] FFmpeg.wasm library (~25MB WebAssembly module)
- [ ] Web Workers support for background processing
- [ ] Modern browser with WebAssembly support
- [ ] Sufficient browser memory limits (512MB+ recommended)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with complete FFmpeg.wasm integration
- [ ] Video-to-WebP conversion pipeline working end-to-end
- [ ] Memory management preventing browser crashes
- [ ] Error handling for all common failure scenarios
- [ ] Performance testing with various video sizes and formats
- [ ] Web Worker implementation for non-blocking UI
- [ ] Progress tracking and cancellation functionality working
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Code follows established vanilla JS module patterns
