# Task: Progress & Download System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive progress tracking and file download system that provides real-time feedback during video conversion and enables users to download the resulting WebP files. The system includes visual progress indicators, status messages, conversion cancellation, and automatic file download functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Real-time progress bar showing conversion percentage (0-100%)
- [ ] Status messages for different conversion phases (loading, processing, encoding, completing)
- [ ] Estimated time remaining calculation and display
- [ ] Conversion cancellation functionality with cleanup
- [ ] Automatic file download when conversion completes
- [ ] Custom filename generation based on original video name
- [ ] File size display for both input and output files
- [ ] Download retry mechanism for failed downloads
- [ ] Progress persistence across page refreshes (optional)
- [ ] Success/error notifications with clear messaging

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Event-driven progress system with download manager
- Key considerations:
  - Integrate with FFmpeg.wasm progress callbacks
  - Handle browser download restrictions and permissions
  - Provide visual feedback for all conversion states
  - Implement proper error recovery and retry mechanisms
  - Support download cancellation and cleanup
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/js/modules/ProgressTracker.js` - Progress monitoring and display
  - `/js/modules/DownloadManager.js` - File download orchestration
  - `/js/modules/StatusDisplay.js` - User notification system
  - `/styles/components/progress-indicator.css` - Progress bar styling
  - `/js/modules/ConversionController.js` - Main conversion orchestrator

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 - FFmpeg.wasm Integration (requires conversion functionality)
- [ ] Browser File API for download functionality
- [ ] Progress callback integration with FFmpeg processing
- [ ] Blob API for file generation and download
- [ ] Local storage (optional, for progress persistence)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-14 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with real-time progress tracking
- [ ] Download functionality working across all target browsers
- [ ] Progress cancellation and cleanup working properly
- [ ] Visual progress indicators and status messages implemented
- [ ] Error handling and retry mechanisms functioning
- [ ] File naming and size display working correctly
- [ ] Cross-browser download compatibility verified
- [ ] Mobile device download functionality tested
- [ ] Integration tests with conversion pipeline passing
- [ ] Code follows established vanilla JS module patterns
