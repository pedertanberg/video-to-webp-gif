# Task: Setup & Foundation

## Description
Establish the foundational project structure, development environment, and basic HTML/CSS scaffolding for the video-to-webp-gif-converter application. This includes setting up the core file structure, implementing the basic layout with CSS Grid/Flexbox, and preparing the development environment for vanilla JavaScript development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Project directory structure is created with logical organization
- [ ] Basic HTML skeleton with semantic markup is implemented
- [ ] CSS foundation with responsive design using Grid/Flexbox is established
- [ ] Development server setup for local testing
- [ ] Basic styling for upload zone, video player area, and controls sections
- [ ] Mobile-first responsive design (320px to 1920px viewports)
- [ ] Cross-browser CSS reset and normalization

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Vanilla JavaScript with modular ES6 structure
- Key considerations:
  - Minimize initial bundle size
  - Ensure WebAssembly MIME type support
  - Progressive enhancement for older browsers
  - Accessibility foundations (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/index.html` - Main application entry point
  - `/styles/main.css` - Core styling and responsive layout
  - `/js/modules/` - JavaScript module structure
  - `/assets/` - Static assets directory
  - Local development server configuration

## Dependencies
- [ ] Modern browser with File API support
- [ ] Local development server (Python http.server, Node.js serve, etc.)
- [ ] No external CSS frameworks (vanilla implementation)

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with semantic HTML structure
- [ ] Responsive CSS layout works across target viewport sizes
- [ ] Development server serves files correctly with proper MIME types
- [ ] Basic accessibility features implemented (semantic markup, keyboard navigation)
- [ ] Cross-browser CSS compatibility verified
- [ ] Code follows established vanilla JS module patterns
