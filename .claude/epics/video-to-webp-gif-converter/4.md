# Task: File Upload System

## Description
Implement a comprehensive file upload system with drag-and-drop interface, MP4 file validation, size limits, and robust error handling. The system should provide clear visual feedback during upload states and validate files before processing to ensure only supported MP4 videos are accepted.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Drag-and-drop zone with visual hover states and feedback
- [ ] Click-to-browse file selection fallback
- [ ] MP4 file type validation (MIME type and extension checking)
- [ ] File size validation with configurable limits (default: 100MB max)
- [ ] Visual upload progress indication
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid files or upload failures
- [ ] File preview thumbnail generation after successful upload
- [ ] Support for replacing uploaded files
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility for file selection

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: HTML5 File API with drag-and-drop events
- Key considerations:
  - Memory management for large video files
  - Progressive file reading to avoid browser freezing
  - Detailed error handling for various failure scenarios
  - Visual feedback during all upload states
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/js/modules/FileHandler.js` - Core file handling logic
  - `/js/modules/FileValidator.js` - File validation utilities
  - `/styles/upload.css` - Upload zone styling and states
  - `/index.html` - Upload zone markup

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 2 (Setup & Foundation) - requires basic HTML/CSS structure
- [ ] HTML5 File API browser support
- [ ] Canvas API for thumbnail generation

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 10-14 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with comprehensive file validation
- [ ] Drag-and-drop functionality works across target browsers
- [ ] Error handling covers all edge cases (oversized files, wrong format, corrupted files)
- [ ] Visual states clearly communicate upload progress and status
- [ ] File validation catches 100% of invalid MP4 inputs
- [ ] Accessibility features implemented (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for large file handling
