# Epic: video-to-webp-gif-converter

## Overview

A client-side web application built with vanilla JavaScript and WebAssembly for converting MP4 videos to animated WebP images. The application leverages FFmpeg.wasm for video processing and provides a simple drag-and-drop interface with timeline-based segment selection. All processing happens in the browser to ensure privacy and eliminate server costs.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript to minimize bundle size and complexity
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg.wasm for robust MP4 handling and WebP conversion
- **UI Framework**: Custom CSS with CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive design
- **State Management**: Simple JavaScript modules, no complex state library needed
- **File Handling**: HTML5 File API with drag-and-drop support
- **Deployment**: Static hosting (Netlify/Vercel) for minimal operational overhead

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

**Core Modules:**
- `FileHandler`: Manages upload, validation, and file processing
- `VideoPlayer`: Custom video player with timeline scrubbing
- `RangeSelector`: Visual start/end point selection on timeline
- `Converter`: WebAssembly integration for video-to-WebP conversion
- `ProgressTracker`: Real-time conversion progress feedback

**UI Components:**
- Upload zone with drag-and-drop styling
- Video preview with custom controls
- Timeline with draggable range markers
- Progress indicator with status messages
- Download button with file name display

### Backend Services

**None required** - Full client-side implementation eliminates backend complexity and ensures user privacy.

### Infrastructure

**Static Web App Deployment:**
- CDN distribution for global performance
- HTTPS-only for secure file handling
- Gzip compression for faster loading
- WebAssembly MIME type configuration

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Progressive enhancement for older browsers
- WebAssembly feature detection with fallback messaging
- File API support validation

## Implementation Strategy

**Development Phases:**

1. **Foundation** (Week 1): Core file handling and validation
2. **Video Processing** (Week 2): FFmpeg.wasm integration and WebP conversion
3. **User Interface** (Week 3): Timeline controls and range selection
4. **Polish & Testing** (Week 4): Cross-browser testing and performance optimization

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Early WebAssembly performance testing with large files
- Fallback UI states for unsupported browsers
- Memory management for large video files
- Error handling for corrupted/unsupported MP4 files

**Testing Approach:**
- Unit tests for core conversion logic
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Performance testing with various file sizes
- User experience testing with target personas

## Task Breakdown Preview

High-level task categories that will be created:
- [ ] **Setup & Foundation**: Project structure, dependencies, basic HTML/CSS
- [ ] **File Upload System**: Drag-and-drop, validation, error handling
- [ ] **Video Player Implementation**: Custom player with timeline scrubber
- [ ] **Range Selection Tool**: Draggable markers for start/end points
- [ ] **FFmpeg.wasm Integration**: Video processing and WebP conversion
- [ ] **Progress & Download System**: Status tracking and file delivery
- [ ] **UI/UX Polish**: Responsive design, error states, accessibility
- [ ] **Cross-browser Testing**: Compatibility validation and bug fixes

## Dependencies

**External Libraries:**
- FFmpeg.wasm (~25MB) - Video processing and WebP encoding
- Modern browser APIs (File API, Canvas API, Web Workers)

**Development Dependencies:**
- Local development server
- Cross-browser testing tools
- Performance profiling tools

**Deployment Dependencies:**
- Static hosting platform with WebAssembly support
- CDN for global distribution

## Success Criteria (Technical)

**Performance Benchmarks:**
- Application loads in under 3 seconds on 3G connection
- 10-second video conversion completes in under 30 seconds
- Memory usage stays under 500MB during processing
- 95% success rate across target browsers

**Quality Gates:**
- Zero console errors on supported browsers
- Responsive design works on 320px to 1920px viewports
- File validation catches 100% of invalid inputs
- Progress indicators accurately reflect conversion status

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can complete full workflow (upload → select → convert → download) without tutorial
- Error messages are clear and actionable
- WebP output files are 25%+ smaller than equivalent GIFs
- Application works offline after initial load

## Estimated Effort

**Overall Timeline:** 4 weeks for MVP, 6 weeks for production-ready

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 frontend developer
- Access to cross-browser testing tools
- Static hosting platform

**Critical Path Items:**
1. FFmpeg.wasm integration and performance validation (Week 2)
2. Timeline UI with precise range selection (Week 3)
3. Cross-browser testing and compatibility fixes (Week 4)
