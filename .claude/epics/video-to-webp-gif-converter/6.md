# Task: Range Selection Tool

## Description
Implement a visual range selection tool that allows users to select start and end points on the video timeline using draggable markers. The tool provides visual feedback during selection and enforces a 10-second maximum duration validation to ensure optimal WebP file sizes and processing performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Draggable start and end point markers on video timeline
- [ ] Visual feedback showing selected range (highlighted timeline segment)
- [ ] 10-second maximum duration validation with user feedback
- [ ] Precise time display for start/end points (MM:SS format)
- [ ] Range markers snap to video frames for accuracy
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility for marker positioning (arrow keys)
- [ ] Touch support for mobile devices
- [ ] Clear visual indicators for invalid selections
- [ ] Reset functionality to clear current selection

## Technical Details
- Implementation approach: Custom HTML5 range inputs overlaid on video timeline
- Key considerations:
  - Synchronize marker positions with video playback time
  - Handle edge cases (markers crossing, invalid ranges)
  - Provide smooth dragging experience with visual feedback
  - Integrate with video player seekbar functionality
- Code locations/files affected:
  - `/js/modules/RangeSelector.js` - Core range selection logic
  - `/js/modules/VideoPlayer.js` - Integration with video timeline
  - `/styles/components/range-selector.css` - Visual styling
  - `/js/modules/ValidationHandler.js` - Duration validation logic

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 5 - Video Player Implementation (requires timeline component)
- [ ] Video timeline component with scrubbing functionality
- [ ] Drag and drop gesture handling utilities
- [ ] Time formatting utilities

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: false

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented with smooth dragging functionality
- [ ] 10-second validation working with clear error messages
- [ ] Visual feedback implemented for range selection
- [ ] Touch and keyboard accessibility features working
- [ ] Integration tests with video player component passing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness tested and working
- [ ] Code follows established vanilla JS module patterns
