# Task: Cross-browser Testing

## Description
Comprehensive browser compatibility testing, performance validation across different environments, bug fixes for browser-specific issues, and implementation of fallback handling for unsupported features. Ensure the application works reliably across all target browsers and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Application tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest 2 versions)
- [ ] WebAssembly support detection and fallback messaging implemented
- [ ] File API compatibility verified across all target browsers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met on all tested browsers
- [ ] Browser-specific bugs identified and fixed
- [ ] Graceful degradation for older browsers implemented
- [ ] Memory usage stays under 500MB during processing on all browsers
- [ ] 95% success rate achieved across target browsers
- [ ] Mobile browser compatibility verified (Chrome Mobile, Safari Mobile)
- [ ] Offline functionality tested after initial load

## Technical Details
- Set up cross-browser testing environment (BrowserStack or similar)
- Implement feature detection for WebAssembly, File API, and other modern APIs
- Create fallback UI for browsers without WebAssembly support
- Add polyfills for missing JavaScript features
- Test memory management across different JavaScript engines
- Validate timeline scrubbing performance on different browsers
- Test drag-and-drop functionality across browsers and devices
- Verify WebP output compatibility and download behavior
- Profile performance with browser developer tools
- Test with various file sizes and formats across browsers

## Dependencies
- [ ] UI/UX Polish (Task 8) - needs polished interface for comprehensive testing
- [ ] All core functionality must be stable before testing begins

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 18-24 hours
- Parallel: false (requires systematic testing approach)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test suite executed on all target browsers
- [ ] Browser compatibility matrix documented
- [ ] All critical bugs fixed and retested
- [ ] Fallback implementations working for unsupported browsers
- [ ] Performance benchmarks verified and documented
- [ ] Memory usage profiled and optimized if needed
- [ ] Mobile browser testing completed
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed on multiple devices
- [ ] Production deployment tested in staging environment
