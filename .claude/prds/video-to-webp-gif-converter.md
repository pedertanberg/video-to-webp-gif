# PRD: video-to-webp-gif-converter

## Executive Summary

A standalone web application that enables content creators and marketing managers to convert MP4 videos into animated WebP images optimized for email marketing and landing pages. The tool focuses on simplicity and efficiency, allowing users to select a specific 10-second segment from videos up to 90 seconds long and convert it to a high-quality animated WebP file.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Content creators and marketing managers need a simple way to create animated images from video content for use in email campaigns and landing pages. Current solutions are either too complex, require desktop software installation, or don't provide the specific output format (WebP) that offers the best compression and quality balance for web use.

**Why is this important now?**
- Animated content significantly increases engagement in email marketing and web pages
- WebP format provides superior compression compared to traditional GIFs (25-35% smaller file sizes)
- Many existing tools are overly complex or don't support WebP output
- Marketing teams need quick, browser-based solutions that don't require technical expertise

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas

**Content Creator (Sarah)**
- Creates marketing materials for social media and email campaigns
- Needs quick conversion tools that work in the browser
- Values simplicity and speed over advanced features
- Works with video content from various sources

**Marketing Manager (Mike)**
- Oversees email campaign creation and landing page optimization
- Focuses on file size optimization for faster load times
- Needs reliable, consistent output quality
- Values tools that team members can use without training

### User Journeys

**Primary Journey: Video to WebP Conversion**
1. User uploads MP4 video file (up to 90 seconds)
2. User previews video in built-in player
3. User selects start and end points (max 10-second duration)
4. System processes and converts selected segment to animated WebP
5. User downloads optimized WebP file for use in campaigns

### Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Complex desktop software**: Users don't want to install and learn complex video editing tools
- **Poor web tools**: Existing online converters often have quality issues or limited format support
- **File size concerns**: Need optimized output for email and web delivery
- **Time constraints**: Marketing teams need quick turnaround for campaign materials

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- MP4 video file upload (drag-and-drop and file selector)
- Video preview player with timeline scrubber
- Duration selection tool (visual start/end markers)
- Real-time preview of selected segment
- WebP conversion engine
- Download functionality for generated WebP files

**User Interactions:**
- Upload: Drag-and-drop or click-to-browse file selection
- Preview: Play/pause video with standard controls
- Selection: Click and drag to set start/end points on timeline
- Conversion: Single-click convert button with progress indicator
- Download: Automatic download or manual download button

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Support videos up to 90 seconds (estimated max 100MB file size)
- Conversion processing time under 30 seconds for 10-second clips
- Web application loads in under 3 seconds
- Works on modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)

**Security:**
- Client-side processing (no video files stored on servers)
- File type validation (MP4 only)
- File size validation (enforce limits)
- No data persistence beyond session

**Usability:**
- Responsive design (desktop and tablet support)
- Intuitive interface requiring no tutorial
- Clear error messages and validation feedback
- Progress indicators for all operations

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- 90% of users successfully convert their first video within 5 minutes
- Average conversion time under 30 seconds
- 95% user satisfaction score on ease of use
- Zero security incidents related to file handling

**Key Metrics:**
- Daily active conversions
- Average file size reduction (target: 25%+ smaller than equivalent GIF)
- User completion rate (upload to download)
- Browser compatibility success rate

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Constraints:**
- Browser-based solution only (no mobile app)
- Client-side processing to avoid server storage costs
- WebAssembly or JavaScript-based video processing
- Limited to MP4 input format due to browser compatibility

**Resource Constraints:**
- Single developer implementation
- No backend infrastructure required
- Minimal hosting costs (static web app)

**Timeline Constraints:**
- MVP delivery within 4 weeks
- Full feature completion within 6 weeks

**Assumptions:**
- Users have modern browsers with WebAssembly support
- Target audience is comfortable with basic web applications
- MP4 format covers 95% of user needs
- 10-second limit is sufficient for marketing use cases

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- Multi-format video input (AVI, MOV, WebM, etc.)
- GIF output format
- Batch processing capabilities
- Advanced editing features (filters, effects, text overlay)
- User accounts or file storage
- Mobile native applications
- Video compression or quality adjustment settings
- Audio processing or removal options

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- WebAssembly-based video processing library (e.g., FFmpeg.wasm)
- Modern browser APIs (File API, Canvas API, Web Workers)
- WebP encoding library

**Internal Dependencies:**
- Frontend development framework (React/Vue/vanilla JS)
- File validation utilities
- Progress tracking components
- Error handling system

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Test WebAssembly performance across target browsers early
- Have fallback error messages for unsupported browsers
- Validate video processing capabilities with sample files during development
